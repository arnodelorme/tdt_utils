% BARREPORTGUI2 M-file for barreportgui2.fig
%      BARREPORTGUI2, by itself, creates a new BARREPORTGUI2 or raises the existing
%      singleton*.
%
%      H = BARREPORTGUI2 returns the handle to a new BARREPORTGUI2 or the handle to
%      the existing singleton*.
%
%      BARREPORTGUI2('CALLBACK',hObject,eventData,handles,...) calls the local
%      function named CALLBACK in BARREPORTGUI2.M with the given input arguments.
%
%      BARREPORTGUI2('Property','Value',...) creates a new BARREPORTGUI2 or raises the
%      existing singleton*.  Starting from the left, property value pairs are
%      applied to the GUI before barreportgui2_OpeningFcn gets called.  An
%      unrecognized property name or invalid value makes property application
%      stop.  All inputs are passed to barreportgui2_OpeningFcn via varargin.

%      *See GUI Options on GUIDE's Tools menu.  Choose "GUI allows only one
%      instance to run (singleton)".
