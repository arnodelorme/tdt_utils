This plugin computes spectral, coherence values based on the Lexicor documentation. It may also be used to plot TDT file content (including Neuroguide output files).

Thanks to Robert Lawson from EEGWorks for assistance on these tools.

Testing files:
- test_lexicor_power.m - this compares the output of Lexicor software for power analysis with the output of the MATLAB function in this repository
- test_lexicor_phase.m - this compares the output of Lexicor software for phase analysis with the output of the MATLAB function in this repository
